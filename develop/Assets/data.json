        "Cepheid Variables are stars which brighten and dim periodically. They can vary both in temperature and diameter. They pulsate because there is a periodic expansion and contraction of the surface layer of the star.",
        "In 1912, a woman called Henrietta Swan Leavitt noticed that some stars were getting brighter and dimmer and was able to measure the timing of these ups and downs. With these measurements, the scientist could determine the period of these stars. With this, by calculating the absolute magnitude and the apparent magnitude we can infer the distance of these stars to Earth. They became ‘standard candles’.",
        "For example, when there are two stars with the same apparent magnitude but different periods, the one with the longest period is farther away. This behaviour exhibits a relation between period and luminosity in the sense that the longer the period of the star, the greater its intrinsic brightness; this period-luminosity relationship has been used to establish the distances in the universe.",
        "Leavitt was able to measure the period of each star by measuring the timing of its fluctuations in brightness. What she determined was that the brighter the Cepheid, the longer its period. In fact, Cepheids are very special variable stars because their period is regular. Once the intrinsic brightness is known, the distance of the star can be deduced from a comparison of intrinsic and apparent (measured) brightness."

Normally the accretion of matter forms what is called an accretion disc (see image below).",

The classical nova outburst happens when the matter from the accretion disc builds up on the surface of the hot white dwarf and reaches a temperature that causes a runaway hydrogen fusion reaction. This causes a very bright outburst.",
        "Another type of outburst, called the dwarf nova, is caused by instability in the accretion disc. When the gas reaches a critical temperature, it changes the viscosity of the disc which results in an increase in the rate of accretion into the white dwarf, temporarily heating the whole disc. Dwarf nova are less bright than classical nova but happen more frequently. Under certain circumstances the white dwarf can supernova which causes a very bright outburst."

      "about": [
        "One type of supernova is caused by the end of life of a dying massive star. This happens when a star at least 8 times the mass of our sun goes out with an explosion. A star is in balance between two opposite forces. The star’s gravity tries to squeeze the star into the smallest, tightest ball possible. But the nuclear fuel burning in the star’s core creates strong outward pressure. This outward push resists the inward squeeze of gravity.",
        "A supernova explosion will occur when there is no longer enough fuel for the fusion process in the core of the star to create an outward pressure which combats the inward gravitational pull of the star's great mass. First, the star will swell into a red supergiant on the outside. On the inside, the core yields to gravity and begins shrinking. As it shrinks, it grows hotter and denser. When a massive star runs out of fuel, it cools off.",
        "This causes the pressure to drop. Gravity wins out, and the star suddenly collapses. The collapse happens so quickly that it creates enormous shock waves that cause the outer part of the star to explode! Usually a very dense core is left behind, along with an expanding cloud of hot gas called a nebula. A supernova of a star more than about 10 times the size of our sun may leave behind the densest object in the universe – a black hole.",
        "Another type of supernova can happen in systems where two stars orbit one another and at least one of those stars is a white dwarf. A white dwarf is about the size of the earth and it is what's left after a star the size of up to about 8 times that of the sun has run out of fuel. The white dwarf can gain mass and density from the “companion” star and this gain could eventually result in the dwarf reaching the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses.",
        "As it approaches that limit, pressure builds and the internal temperature rises enough for carbon fusion to begin. The majority of white dwarfs are composed mostly of carbon, and when this fusion occurs, all the carbon undergoes fusion instantly. The result is a white dwarf supernova. Scientists have learned a lot about the universe by studying supernovas. They use the white dwarf type of supernova like a ruler to measure distances in space."
